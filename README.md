## Notes
8 days ago I was totally new in Android development.. And then my friend sent me [this link about bootcamp](http://codepath.com/).
After applying  I understood I have only 1 week to do SimpleToDo, my first app. I started "explearning" new area.
These days were incredible exciting. And of course difficult and challenging. And I like it :-)
Every day I got new things, implemented it in app. 
So I fell in love with Android development :-) I even couldn't sleep :-)
Of course this app is not perfect and will be improved - new features will be added, new design (actually it has "no design" 
because I didn't have time to play with views, colors,themes, etc, eventhough design is probably one of the most important
thing in mobile app, I think), some parts of code should be revised.

So it's just a beginning.
Thank you.
